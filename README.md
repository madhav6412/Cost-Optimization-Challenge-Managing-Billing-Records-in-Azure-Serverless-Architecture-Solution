# Cost Optimized Archival with Azure

We can use below proposed for cost optimization in managing billing records using Azure serverless architecture is solid and aligns perfectly with Azure best practices.

Simplified Explanation (Easier to Apply)

Active Data in Cosmos DB:
Your app fetches frequently used (hot) data from Cosmos DB—fast and low-latency.

Azure Data Factory (ADF):
Every month, ADF triggers a job that:

Copies old data from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage.

Then deletes that old data from Cosmos DB to reduce storage costs.

Blob Storage Archive:
The archived data is stored cheaply in Azure Blob (cold tier).

Fallback Querying:
If the app doesn't find data in Cosmos DB, it queries Blob Storage as a fallback.

Validation of Solution

Meets All Given Constraints:
No Data Loss & No Downtime: Azure Data Factory (ADF) enables a controlled, repeatable archiving process with no downtime.

No Changes to API Contracts: Read/write APIs stay intact; only internal logic is adjusted to check both Cosmos DB and Blob Storage.

Simplicity & Ease of Implementation: ADF pipelines and Azure Blob Storage are straightforward to set up and maintain.

Latency within Seconds: Azure Blob Storage (Cool Tier) ensures low-latency reads (ms), supporting your latency requirements.

Cost Savings:
Cosmos DB is premium storage; offloading cold data (~older than 3 months) to Blob Storage significantly reduces storage and RU costs.

Clever Application Logic:
Your pseudocode implementation ensures the service tries Cosmos DB first, then Blob Storage — no contract breakage, just smarter access.

Good Architectural Tradeoffs:
The archive tier was correctly ruled out due to its high access latency.

TTL and change feed were evaluated and rightly excluded due to the deletion visibility gap.
